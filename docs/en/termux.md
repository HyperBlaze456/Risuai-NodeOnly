# Termux Installation Guide

This guide explains how to build and run PocketRisu directly on an Android phone using Termux. The intended use pattern is to open `http://localhost:6001` in the phone's own browser.

- [1. Prerequisites](#1-prerequisites) — Termux and system requirements
- [2. Install and Build](#2-install-and-build) — single-command setup
- [3. Run and Connect](#3-run-and-connect) — open from the phone's browser
- [4. Keep It Running](#4-keep-it-running) — survive screen-off
- [5. Update](#5-update) — pull the latest version
- [6. Limitations](#6-limitations) — features that do not work on Termux


## System Requirements

| Item              | Minimum         | Recommended                |
| ----------------- | --------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Android**       | 7.0 (API 24)    | 10 or newer                |
| **CPU**           | ARM64           | ARM64                      |
| **RAM**           | 2 GB            | 4 GB or more               |
| **Free storage** | 2 GB            | 4 GB or more (with build)  |

PocketRisu does not ship pre-compiled binaries for Termux, so the phone builds everything itself. Including native modules such as `better-sqlite3`, the build takes roughly **10 to 40 minutes** depending on phone performance.


---

## 1. Prerequisites

### Install Termux

Install Termux from one of:

- **F-Droid (recommended)**: https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/
- **GitHub Releases**: https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases
- **Google Play**: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux&hl=en&pli=1


---

## 2. Install and Build

Open Termux and run this single command:

```bash
pkg install -y git && \
  git clone https://github.com/PocketRisu/PocketRisu.git && \
  cd PocketRisu && \
  bash scripts/termux/build.sh
```

The command takes care of:

1. Installing `git`
2. Cloning the PocketRisu repository
3. Installing build dependencies (`nodejs-lts`, `python`, `make`, `clang`, `pnpm`, etc.)
4. `pnpm install` — JavaScript dependencies and native module compilation
5. `pnpm build` — frontend bundling

When the build finishes, you'll see:

```
Build OK. Start the server with:
  node server/node/server.cjs

Then open this address in the phone's own browser:
  http://localhost:6001
```


---

## 3. Run and Connect

From the same directory, start the server:

```bash
node server/node/server.cjs
```

Once the server boot log appears, open the phone's browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:6001
```

The PocketRisu UI should load. `localhost` is automatically treated as a secure context by the browser, so clipboard, `crypto.subtle`, and other secure-context APIs work normally.

Stop the server with `Ctrl + C`.


---

## 4. Keep It Running

To keep the server alive when the screen turns off or you switch to other apps, enable Termux's wake lock:

```bash
termux-wake-lock
```

The Termux notification will show the wake-lock indicator, and the server continues to run even with the screen off.

Release with: `termux-wake-unlock`

> Android may still kill Termux under memory pressure. For long-running use, exclude Termux from your phone's battery optimization settings.


---

## 5. Update

Stop the running server with `Ctrl + C`, then run:

```bash
cd ~/PocketRisu && \
  git pull --ff-only && \
  GYP_DEFINES="android_ndk_path=''" pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && \
  NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=2048" pnpm build
```

Each step runs only if the previous one succeeded, so the command stops at the first error instead of rebuilding the old version without updated sources. When the build completes, start the server again with `node server/node/server.cjs`.

- `pnpm install` applies dependency changes in the new version. Run it on every update; it finishes right away when nothing changed.
- `GYP_DEFINES` is the same Termux setting the build script uses. It is needed when native modules such as `better-sqlite3` are recompiled.

### If `git pull` fails

If `git pull` stops with `Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge` or `Not possible to fast-forward`, reset the source to the latest version with the following command, then run the update command above again:

```bash
cd ~/PocketRisu && git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/main
```

The `save/` and `backups/` folders are not tracked by git, so chats, characters, and settings stay as they are. Any edits you made to source files (a changed port, dependencies changed with `pnpm add`, and so on) are discarded.

## 6. Limitations

**Quick Tunnel (Cloudflare auto tunnel) does not work on Termux.** The `cloudflared` binary is incompatible with Termux's DNS and TLS environment.

PocketRisu detects the Termux environment automatically and shows a warning in the Remote Access menu, hiding the start button.
